### Task

1. You have to redesign a 1-page website.

2. The website must have a navigation menu which can redirect to the appropriate section. 

3. The website is of the Statue of Unity, so feel free to use colours and animations. Using Parallax is a Plus.

4. The website must be Mobile friendly.

5. “Lorem ipsum..” can be used for long descriptions.

6. You can put any values for the given points to be added on the website. For example, you should create Random Text testimonials.

7. You can use any CSS frameworks you like.
