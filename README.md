# Web Design Problem - 1 : Statue of Unity


## The Problem statement was given as below

### Problem
Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Rashtriya Ekta Trust (SVPRET) is looking for a web designer to redesign the website of ‘Statue of Unity’. The purpose of redesigning the website is to improve user experience, which will allow the users to access the information easily from the website to plan their visit better. As ‘Statue of Unity’ is the largest monument in the world, the design of the website should give a feel of how grandeur the monument would be in reality.

The Website they want is a “Single Page” or “1 Page” Website. You must provide the Navigation that will take the user to the appropriate section on click. Moreover, the website should be responsive on all devices i.e. Mobile, Tablet, Laptop & Desktop.

### Task

1. You have to redesign a 1-page website.

2. The website must have a navigation menu which can redirect to the appropriate section. 

3. The website is of the Statue of Unity, so feel free to use colours and animations. Using Parallax is a Plus.

4. The website must be Mobile friendly.

5. “Lorem ipsum..” can be used for long descriptions.

6. You can put any values for the given points to be added on the website. For example, you should create Random Text testimonials.

7. You can use any CSS frameworks you like.
